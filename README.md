### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying computer science and technology at [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm) where I am advised by [Prof. Ruiquan Ge](https://faculty.hdu.edu.cn/jsjxy/grq/main.htm) and [Prof. Changmiao Wang](https://www.sribd.cn/teacher/505). I have a broad interest in deep learning models, with a primary focus on Medical Image Analysis (specialized in Diffusion Model-Based CT Metal Artifact Reduction currently. I am also an enthusiastic self-learner and interested in various fields of computer science. I am currently interning at Hikvision Research Institute, focusing on Deep Learning-Based 3D Fusion for Extended Depth-of-Field Microscopy. From September 2025, I plan to pursue my master's degree at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn) supervised by [Prof. Yikun Zhang](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/yikun/).
