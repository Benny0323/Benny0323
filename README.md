### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I recently graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm) where I am advised by [Prof. Ruiquan Ge](https://faculty.hdu.edu.cn/jsjxy/grq/main.htm) and [Prof. Changmiao Wang](https://www.sribd.cn/teacher/505). I have a broad interest in deep learning models, with a primary focus on Medical Image Analysis. I am also an enthusiastic self-learner and interested in various fields of computer science. From Nov 2024 to Feb 2025, I was interning at [Hikvision Research](https://www.hikvision.com/cn/) Institute, focusing on Deep Learning-Based 3D Depth From Focus for Extended Depth-of-Field Microscopy. Starting in September 2025, I will pursue my master's degree at the Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn), Nanjing, and also with the [Key Laboratory of New Generation Artificial Intelligence Technology and Its Interdisciplinary Applications (Southeast University)](https://aiia.seu.edu.cn), Ministry of Education, China, supervised by [Prof. Yikun Zhang](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/yikun/) specialized in **SAM & Diffusion Model-Based CT Metal Artifact Reduction**.
