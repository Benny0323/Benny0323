### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently pursuing my masterâ€™s degree at the Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn), Nanjing, specializing in Deep Learning-Based CT Metal Artifact Reduction under the supervision of [Prof. Yikun Zhang](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/yikun/). I have a broad interest in deep learning models, particularly in Medical Image Analysis and Generative AI Models, and I am also an enthusiastic self-learner with diverse interests in computer science.
